    "You can see that there are multiple characters that say (somewhat) complete sentences, but it doesn't have to be perfect! It takes quite a while to get good results, and often, you'll have to use a smaller vocabulary (and discard uncommon words), or get more data.  The Seinfeld dataset is about 3.4 MB, which is big enough for our purposes; for script generation you'll want more than 1 MB of text, generally. \n",
